note to grader: my DFS works as far as my testing shows, however my function for finding SCC's only works 1/4 of the time, I have it printing to STDOUT and to the outfile just so that you may see how far it gets before finding a Segmentation fault that I'm unable to figure out.  Obviously if it succeeds (as with in1 and in4) it will write to the outfile.

thanks!
