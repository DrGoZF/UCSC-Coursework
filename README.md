This is a repository for coursework done by myself, Tim Mertogul, while completing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at University of California, Santa Cruz.  Some assignments were done alone and other assignments were done as per the “pair-programming.pdf” specifications, located in this directory.  

Every assignment directory also contains a PDF of the assignment specifications, and most directories contain some form of testing files and the appropriate score files as well.
